        You are given integers K, M and a non-empty array A consisting of N integers. 
        Every element of the array is not greater than M.

        You should divide this array into K blocks of consecutive elements. 
        The size of the block is any integer between 0 and N. 
        Every element of the array should belong to some block.

        The sum of the block from X to Y equals A[X] + A[X + 1] + ... + A[Y]. 
        The sum of empty block equals 0.

        The large sum is the maximal sum of any block.
        For example, you are given integers K = 3, M = 5 and array A such that:
            A[0] = 2
            A[1] = 1
            A[2] = 5
            A[3] = 1
            A[4] = 2
            A[5] = 2
            A[6] = 2
        The array can be divided, for example, into the following blocks:
            [2, 1, 5, 1, 2, 2, 2], [], [] with a large sum of 15;
            [2], [1, 5, 1, 2], [2, 2] with a large sum of 9;
            [2, 1, 5], [], [1, 2, 2, 2] with a large sum of 8;
            [2, 1], [5, 1], [2, 2, 2] with a large sum of 6.
        The goal is to minimize the large sum. 
        In the above example, 6 is the minimal large sum.

        Write a function:

            class Solution { public int solution(int K, int M, int[] A); }

        that, given integers K, M and a non-empty array A consisting of N integers, 
        returns the minimal large sum.

        For example, given K = 3, M = 5 and array A such that:
            A[0] = 2
            A[1] = 1
            A[2] = 5
            A[3] = 1
            A[4] = 2
            A[5] = 2
            A[6] = 2
        the function should return 6, as explained above.

        Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:
            N and K are integers within the range [1..100,000];
            M is an integer within the range [0..10,000];
            each element of array A is an integer within the range [0..M].
